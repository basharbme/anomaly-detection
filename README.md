# Anomaly Detection Notebooks

This repository contains some Jupyter notebooks with examples of still-frame anomaly detection.

## Table of Contents:

 * Anomaly Detection (PCA)
    * Anomaly detection using (linear) PCA on the raw RGB channels of an image

 * Anomaly Detection (JPEG-style PCA)
    * Anomay detction using linear PCA applied to the discrete cosine transform
      (DCT) of the channels of an image
 * NEON CAE
    * A convolutional autoencoder trained on the NEON phenocam datasets
      (with fake anomalies)
